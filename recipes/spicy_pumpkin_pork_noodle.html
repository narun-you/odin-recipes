    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spicy Pumpkin Pork Noodles –Accidental Perfection </p>
    <p>I was playing around with ideas for using pumpkin in a
        spicy Asian-style noodle dish, which was originally going
        to be roasted pieces of everyone's favorite seasonal gourd
        tossed with the noodles and sauce, but a terrible thing happened during the test. Yes, a terrible, very
        fortuitous thing. The cubes of pumpkin were too soft, and basically dissolved into the sauce. And, it was
        perfect. </p>
    <p>By the way, that's our little secret, since I'm fine with the general public thinking it was simply a stroke of
        recipe development genius. The other, intentional stroke of recipe development genius was using bucatini for the
        noodles. Any pasta or other noddle would work just fine here, but the hollow spaghetti did a wonderful job of
        sucking up all that lovely sauce, and I loved the final texture of the dish. </p>
    <p>If you don't want to roast a sugar pumpkin, a can of pure pumpkin puree (NOT pumpkin pie filling) would be
        acceptable. Alternatively, leftover kabocha, butternut, or acorn squash would also be great choices. Depending
        on the brand, you may have to adjust the Korean chili paste amounts, but you'll figure that out. You can also
        add seasonal greens to this, as well as switch up the meat choice for the topping. Regardless of how you adapt
        this, I loved how it came out, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat and cook pork, while breaking up into small pieces, 2 to 3
                minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika and keep cooking and stirring until pork is
                crumble and is browned up, about 5 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Lower heat to medium and add garlic and green onions. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Mix in hoisin
                sauce and cook until sauce has glazed over all the pork pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer pork topping to
                a bowl. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Pour out cooking grease but leave 1 tablespoon of grease in the skillet. Add pumpkin puree, gochujang,
                green onions, sesame oil, and chili peppers. Cook and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bucatini the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Fish out noodles and drop into the
                skillet with the pumpkin sauce. Reserve about 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Squeeze lime juice on top of the noodles. Add about 2 tablespoons pasta water on top and mix noodles with
                the sauce until well combined. Keep adding pasta water, a little at a time, until sauce has reached your
                preferred consistency. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Turn off heat and stir in chopped cilantro. Transfer noodles to a plate and top with ground pork. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
